# Unleash the Power of YouTube Data

Our platform empowers users to extract, store, and analyze YouTube channel data with ease. By combining SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit, we deliver a user-friendly application that transforms raw YouTube data into actionable insights.

# Project Components

Intuitive Interface: A user-friendly Streamlit application allows for seamless interaction and data exploration.
Data Acquisition: We leverage the YouTube API to fetch comprehensive channel and video data.
Flexible Data Storage: A MongoDB data lake stores raw data in a scalable and adaptable format.
Optimized Data Analysis: Migrated data is stored in a SQL data warehouse for efficient querying and analysis.
Visual Insights: Powerful data visualizations generated by Streamlit provide clear and actionable insights.

# Technologies Used

The following technologies are used in this project:

Python: The programming language used for building the application and scripting tasks.
Streamlit: A Python library used for creating interactive web applications and data visualizations.
YouTube API: Google API is used to retrieve channel and video data from YouTube.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used as a data lake for storing retrieved YouTube data.
SQL (MySQL): A relational database used as a data warehouse for storing migrated YouTube data.
SQLAlchemy: A Python library used for SQL database connectivity and interaction.
Pandas: A data manipulation library used for data processing and analysis.
Matplotlib: A data visualization library used for creating charts and graphs.

# Setting Up Your Environment
To begin using our YouTube Data Analysis Platform, follow these steps:

Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest version from https://www.python.org/.
Gather Dependencies: Use pip or conda to install the required libraries: Streamlit, MongoDB driver, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Obtain API Credentials: Create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the YouTube Data API. Generate an API key and client secret.
Prepare Your Databases: Set up a MongoDB database and a SQL database (MySQL) to store your data.
Configure the Application: Provide your API credentials and database connection details in the configuration file.
# Running the Application
Once your environment is set up, launch the Streamlit application using the command line. This will start a local web server, allowing you to interact with the platform through your web browser.

# Conclusion

Our YouTube Data Analysis Platform offers a robust solution for transforming raw YouTube data into actionable insights. By combining the flexibility of MongoDB, the efficiency of SQL, and the user-friendliness of Streamlit, we empower users to explore, analyze, and visualize YouTube trends with ease. This platform is a valuable tool for businesses, researchers, and content creators seeking to understand the YouTube landscape.
